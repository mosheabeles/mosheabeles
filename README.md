I am novice to Arduino.  Currently I am building an active shock absorber whose control is Arduino Uno.
I am interested in trying Time of Flight Distance Ranger.
I tried ultrasonic distance ranger but am not satisfied.
1.  It has too wide field of view
2.  When an obstacle enters the field it first report an increase in distance and only later a decrease.
